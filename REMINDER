Slime bindings:
 C-c C-k, C-c C-l   reload file / buffer
 M-.                jump to definition
 C-]                close brackets
 C-Return           close brackets and enter
 C-c C-f            show function help


Common Lisp:
  Don't forget CL has different namespaces for
  variables and functions.  Even for lambdas, you
  need to add the #' prefix:

   #'(lambda (x) (+ x 1))

   (map #'string (list 1 2 3))
