A little profiling with time ./repl -t.

Sunday:
13.645 real -- unoptimized
13.363 real -- when methods are stored in dictionaries
13.295 real -- when in compilation, labels are stored in dictionaries
13.183 real -- after removing maps.fn
13.194 real -- after switching to open addressing.. (hah!)
 2.196 real -- after switching to dframes for frames and dict for global env.

Monday:
 1.217 real -- after switching to dictionaries for macro expanders and
               deleting a couple of unused modules (and tests)
 1.069 real -- after destructuring dynamic lambda lists in an optimized way.

The above measurements are all without gcc optimizations.  With -O1,
the tests run well under 2 seconds, but with -O2 the interpreter
segfaults.  Maybe I should git bisect on that to see how I introduced
it.

[ Cheated: 0.400 real -- after fixing the -O2 issue. ]


 0.790 real -- after fixing value_eq to be a lot quicker.

Oct 13, we're back to 1.012 -- why?


A little more profiling with
(dolist (fn meeeh) (with-timer (compile-fn fn)))

Compile time for: (make-assembler, make-byte-stream, assemble)
Oct 17, with push and pop:                     (579, 521, 375)
Oct 17, without push after reads:              (516, 454, 327)
Oct 17, without push after loads:              (495, 434, 304)
Oct 17, without pop/push around writes:        (495, 430, 301)  -- little improvement.
Oct 17, without push after calls.              (465, 403, 281)
Oct 17, without push after make-lambda:        (451, 393, 273)
Oct 17, without pop before jump-if-true:       (439, 370, 270)
Oct 17, with inlined compile-sequence:         (415, 346, 253)
Oct 17, without pop before return:             (406, 339, 247)
Oct 17, after random refactorings:             (350, 337, 244)  -- make-a. got shorter.
Oct 17, after quick-calling simple procs       (292, 279, 202)  -- NB (105, 99, 72) with gcc -O3 :)
Oct 17, after disabling interpreter debug mode (286, 273, 199)  -- Oops.
Oct 17, after flagging out unneeded checks     (263, 252, 183)

NB -- when disabling the checks in mem_get, mem_set, you go directly to (149, 140, 102)
   -- we are essentially wasting (114, 112, 81) on bounds checks.
   -- these checks are there for safety, it will be tricky to get rid of them.

To be continued...

Performance measured by:
(load-file "examples/grammar-utils.fn")
(with-timer (load-grammar! "examples/lisp.g"))

2013-06-05
With retptrs on stack: 2612-2689ms
With interpreter_state_t as cache of frame: 2712-2830ms
After flattening out code tuples in procedures: 2168-2197ms
After using MEM_GET and MEM_SET macros in some places: 1738-1806ms
After using MEM_GET and MEM_SET macros in even more places: 1742-1773ms
After rearranging fields of compiled-procedure: 1735-1792ms (no improvement...)
After using even more MEM_GETs and MEM_SETs: 1640-1718
After using MEM_GET instead of MEM_GET in is_cons(): 1440-1471
